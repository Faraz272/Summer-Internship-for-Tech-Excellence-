## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

I used a plethora of videos to teach myself about material so that i could implement them into my programs.                       

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The challenge that I personally encountered during this submission is having to learn two new coding languages: HTML was a rather straightforward programming language that required me to understand what front end development is like, but JavaScript felt different from my previous experiences with Python and MatLab. The reason JavaScript felt different ,as compared to Python and MatLab, is because I had to relearn some core elements in order for me to incorporate them correctly in the new code. What really tested my understanding of the two new languages was when I was tasked to code in the game logic. I had to alter some of the previous code that I had implemented and the base code given to me by CodePath in order to find a solution that best fits the problem at hand. This includes simple processes such as functions, variables, if/else statements and the new “console.log” functionality. The main problem that I had with all these was syntax.  I would constantly put in the incorrect syntax as a force of habit hoping it would work. I would run into walls where everything logically made sense and spend hours debugging the issue only to find that javascript couldn't properly read the code that I had given it. A clear example would be with the console.log function as I had never seen it before. I eventually realized that console.log would save the information I put in into the console. When I implemented this code into my game logic I could clearly see that I had written my if/else function incorrectly and could make the necessary steps to fix it. This led me to altering some of the previous code that I had implemented and the base code given to me by CodePath in order to find a solution that best fits the problem at hand.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
During the entirety of the pre-work,I had a multitude of questions pertaining to web development since I have only ever done one short project pertaining to it. As a result, I encountered a lot of broad questions as I gained some more personal experience working on my submission. One of the overarching questions that I had was largely concerned with what might be the best processing system to learn for HTML? What are the unique creative capabilities that HTML offers in contrast to the benefits of  utilizing free software companies-such as Wix.com-and in retrospect, what does it not offer? I also wondered whether JavaScript  is required for web development, or can you use another script language to achieve the same or even different results?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would likely try my best to optimize the code so that it can function better. For example, the sound design in the Light and Sound game works as intended, but I would also want to add the optional feature of speeding it up as the game continues. However, the problem that I experienced occurs when the speed of the game goes by too fast and the sound of each individual button does not even manage to register itself clearly. In my attempt to fix and solve this issue, I ran into another one where the sounds would begin to overlap with one another while creating a strange amalgamation of frequencies. I couldn't quite figure out what was wrong with it, but in the end I thought that the best way to solve this issue was to decrease the amount at which the game sped up. I think the reason why I had so much difficulty with this was the fact I had never worked with sound design before, but I’m sure that if I was given more time I could have found a solution and been able to properly recreate my conceptualization.
